#  Timeline and Project Milestones

This thesis project will be completed over the course of the 2018-2019 school year.  

## Fall Semester

### October
- [x] **10/20:** Setup Github 
- [x] **10/29:** Basic algorithm research done

### November
- [x] **11/5:** Select initial algorithm and dataset
- [x] **11/5:** Lab meeting presentation
- [x] **11/9:** Research on HMMs
- [x] **11/12:** Finish script outline - building model
- [ ] **11/30:** Completed HMM model

In November, signifiant changes to the structure of the thesis were proposed that changed the schedule of research.  I spent the end of November researching additional algorithms and improving my understanding of the computational theory behind them.

### December
- [x] **12/02:** Completed research into common protein classification algorithms
- [ ] **12/11:** Thesis presentation to committee
